# Curated Experiment Snapshots

| File | Scenario | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e1_24ghz_clean.json` | Clean 2.4 GHz line-of-sight chronometric interferometry run | Reference for 13.5 ps recovery; no additive or phase noise. |
| `e1_58ghz_clean.json` | Clean 5.8 GHz high-band run | Demonstrates sub-0.1 ps residual timing error in wideband regime. |
| `e1_multipath_noisy.json` | Noisy RF multipath stress | Intentionally shows estimator drift to hundreds of ns; open calibration item. |
