    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We present a method for achieving picosecond-level time synchronization and sub-ppb frequency stability between two or more nodes. The technique is based on the principles of two-way time transfer (TWTT) and heterodyne interferometry. By exchanging RF signals and analyzing the resulting beat frequency, we can precisely measure the time-of-flight (ToF) and frequency offset between oscillators. This method has wide-ranging applications in modern science and technology, including wireless communications, positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), and scientific and industrial applications.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Time and frequency transfer are fundamental to modern science and technology. This document provides an overview of a technique for achieving picosecond-level time synchronization and sub-ppb frequency stability between two or more nodes. The method is based on the principles of two-way time transfer (TWTT) and heterodyne interferometry. By exchanging RF signals and analyzing the resulting beat frequency, we can precisely measure the time-of-flight (ToF) and frequency offset between oscillators.</p>
    <p>The technique is particularly valuable in wireless systems where precise timing and synchronization are critical, such as in 5G/6G networks, distributed sensor arrays, and precision positioning systems.</p>

    <h2>2. Core Principle</h2>
    <p>The core of the technique is a two-way exchange of RF signals between two nodes, which allows for the cancellation of common-mode noise sources. Each node transmits a signal at a known frequency. When a node receives a signal from the other node, it mixes the incoming signal with its own local oscillator (LO). This process, known as heterodyning, produces a beat frequency signal at the difference between the two oscillator frequencies.</p>
    <p>The phase of this beat frequency signal contains information about the propagation delay (time-of-flight) and the frequency offset between the oscillators. By measuring the phase of the beat signal over time, we can extract these parameters with high precision.</p>

    <h2>3. Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <p>The received signal at Node B, which was transmitted from Node A, can be modeled as a sinusoid with a phase that depends on the time-of-flight and the frequency offset. When this signal is mixed with Node B's local oscillator, the resulting beat note signal can be expressed in complex baseband form as:</p>
    <pre><code>s(t) = A * exp[j(2π(f_A - f_B)t + φ_0 + 2π(f_A - f_B)τ)]</code></pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A is the signal amplitude</li>
      <li>φ_0 is the initial phase offset</li>
      <li>τ is the time-of-flight</li>
      <li>(f_A - f_B) is the frequency difference</li>
    </ul>
