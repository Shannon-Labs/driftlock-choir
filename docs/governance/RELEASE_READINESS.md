## Key AI Review Checkpoints

### Critical Areas for AI Reviewer to Validate:

#### 1. **Technical Accuracy**
- Verify "≈2.1 ps timing precision" claim against E1 simulation data
- Cross-check all performance metrics with corresponding experiments
- Validate mathematical formulations in CHRONOMETRIC_INTERFEROMETRY_EXPLAINED.md
- Confirm test suite actually achieves 100% pass rate

#### 2. **Reproducibility**
- Test installation from fresh Python environment
- Run `python -m src.experiments.e1_basic_beat_note` and verify results
- Execute all example scripts and confirm outputs
- Run full test suite: `pytest tests/ -v`

#### 3. **Documentation Quality**
- Verify all internal links resolve correctly
- Test audio file links and playback
- Check for grammatical errors and typos
- Assess professional tone consistency

#### 4. **Code Quality Sampling**
- Review 3-5 core modules for:
  - Docstring completeness
  - Type hint usage
  - Error handling appropriateness
  - Security vulnerabilities

#### 5. **Claims Validation**
- Ensure all performance claims are properly qualified (simulation vs. hardware)
- Verify comparisons to industry standards (NTP, PTP) are fair
- Check that "musical origin story" is presented factually, not as gimmick

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Validation**: 13 experiments (E1-E13) provide thorough validation from basic physics to deployment scenarios

2. **Professional Documentation**: README, CONTRIBUTING, and technical docs maintain academic/research quality

3. **Reproducibility**: Clear installation instructions, test suite, and example code enable easy reproduction

4. **Novel Approach**: Musical-inspired chronometric interferometry is genuinely innovative and well-presented

5. **Open Science**: MIT license and complete documentation support open research

### Areas Requiring Extra Attention

1. **Simulation vs. Hardware Distinction**: Ensure every performance claim is qualified as simulation-based until hardware validation complete

2. **Audio Demonstrations**: Verify scientific validity of audio representations and accurate descriptions

3. **Mathematical Rigor**: Double-check all equations in technical documentation

4. **Test Suite**: Confirm 100% pass rate claim with actual execution

5. **Professional Tone**: Maintain academic credibility while explaining musical origin

## Recommended AI Review Workflow

### Phase 1: Automated Checks (10 minutes)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd driftlock-choir/driftlockchoir-oss
python -m venv qa_env && source qa_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Check formatting
black --check src/ tests/ examples/
isort --check-only src/ tests/ examples/
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=100

# Validate YAML
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('CITATION.cff'))"
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Review (20 minutes)
- Read README.md top-to-bottom
- Click all internal links
- Check audio file links
- Review CONTRIBUTING.md for completeness
- Scan CHRONOMETRIC_INTERFEROMETRY_EXPLAINED.md for errors

### Phase 3: Functional Validation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Run core experiment
python -m src.experiments.e1_basic_beat_note

# Run examples
python examples/basic_beat_note_demo.py
python examples/oscillator_demo.py
python examples/basic_consensus_demo.py
```

### Phase 4: Code Quality Sampling (15 minutes)
- Review 3-5 core modules for quality
- Check docstrings and type hints
- Look for obvious security issues
- Verify test coverage claims

### Phase 5: Report Generation (10 minutes)
- Use QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md as template
- Document specific issues with file:line references
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Assign overall quality score
