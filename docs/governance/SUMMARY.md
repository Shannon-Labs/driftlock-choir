## Key RF Chronometric Interferometry Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Two-way signal exchange** at 2442 MHz (GPS L1 band reference)
2. **Beat note formation** from frequency differences between oscillators
3. **Phase slope analysis** to extract time-of-flight (τ) and frequency offset (Δf)
4. **Realistic RF channel modeling** with multipath propagation
5. **Practical oscillator modeling** with TCXO phase noise characteristics

## How the Technique Works

The core principle involves:
1. Two nodes exchange RF signals with slightly different oscillator frequencies
2. The returned signal creates a "beat note" when mixed with the local oscillator
3. Analysis of the beat note's phase and frequency characteristics reveals:
   - Time-of-flight delays (τ) in picoseconds
   - Frequency offsets (Δf) between oscillators
4. These measurements enable sub-picosecond precision distance and timing measurements
