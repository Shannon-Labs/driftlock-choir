MSARTEst AI Comprehensive Prompt: Chronometric Interferometry Discoveries from Driftlock Choir Project

Personal Context:
I am a non-technical founder and "vibe coder" with a musical background who stumbled into this field while exploring my great grandfather's patents (Ralph Bown). I'm seeking to modernize his theoretical work in RF systems and timing precision through this open-source project. I have limited formal engineering background but am passionate about the potential applications of this research.

Project Overview:
The Driftlock Choir project is an open-source implementation of chronometric interferometry, a technique that enables picosecond-level precision timing for distributed systems. The research combines RF engineering, signal processing, and distributed systems to create ultra-precise synchronization capabilities.

Technical Specifications:
1. Achieved 13.5 ps line-of-sight recovery in the clean E1 chronometric interferometry experiment
2. Demonstrated sub-ps timing at 5.8 GHz with 0.09 ps RMSE residual error
3. Developed multiple estimation algorithms for extracting time-of-flight (τ) and frequency offset (Δf):
   - Phase-slope estimator: Uses linear relationship between phase and frequency to estimate τ from phase slope
   - Maximum likelihood estimator: Uses numerical optimization to find τ and Δf that maximize likelihood function
   - Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) estimator: Provides theoretical performance bounds
4. Validated performance across multiple RF bands (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz)
5. Created comprehensive analysis tools with uncertainty quantification and quality metrics
6. Documented failure behaviors in noisy multipath scenarios
7. Implementation includes:
   - Physical units with type safety (Seconds, Picoseconds, Hertz, PPM, PPB)
   - RF front-end configuration (carrier frequency, bandwidth, transmit power, noise figure)
   - Multipath channel modeling with delay spread and path gains
   - Oscillator modeling with phase noise characteristics
   - Beat note processing with instantaneous phase and frequency extraction
8. Structured output includes JSON artifacts with metrics, analysis records, and telemetry

Core Technical Components:
- Signal Processing: Beat note formation, phase extraction, frequency analysis
- Estimation Algorithms: Various methods to extract τ and Δf from beat notes
- Channel Modeling: Multipath effects, RF propagation, noise modeling
- Oscillator Modeling: TCXO and OCXO phase noise profiles, frequency stability
- Distributed Systems: Network topology, consensus algorithms, timing synchronization

Technical Approach:
The system works by:
- Generating RF signals from two oscillators with known offsets
- Mixing transmitted and received signals to create a beat note
- Analyzing the phase evolution of the beat note using sophisticated algorithms
- Extracting time-of-flight (τ) and frequency offset (Δf) with uncertainty quantification
- Using the extracted parameters for ultra-precise timing and synchronization

Key Results & Metrics:
- 2.4 GHz clean baseline: |Δτ| = 1.57 ps, |Δf| < 0.2 mHz
- 5.8 GHz high-band: 0.09 ps RMSE residual error
- Multipath failure mode: diverges to hundreds of nanoseconds (motivating calibration research)
- Performance metrics include RMSE timing, RMSE frequency, convergence time, and communication overhead
- Structured output schema for integration with reinforcement learning pipelines

Applications:
- Network-as-a-sensor timing fabric for 6G systems
- Cloud-robotic control loops for remote teleoperation
- Industrial autonomy and reinforcement learning
- Sensing-driven safety for mobility and mixed-reality systems
